FAIR FREELANCE CONTRACT BASELINE (India)

This document outlines what a fair freelance contract should contain according to standard Indian industry practices and legal norms.

1. PAYMENT TERMS
- Standard: Net 30 days from invoice date
- Acceptable: 15-45 days
- Red Flag: Beyond 60 days or conditional payment ("when client gets paid")
- Why: Freelancers need predictable cash flow. Extended payment terms create financial hardship.

2. TERMINATION NOTICE
- Standard: 15-30 days written notice by either party
- Acceptable: 7-30 days mutual notice
- Red Flag: Immediate termination by client without cause, or contractor cannot terminate
- Why: Both parties need time to transition. One-sided termination rights are unfair.

3. LIABILITY CAP
- Standard: Capped at contract value
- Acceptable: Contract value to 2x contract value
- Red Flag: Unlimited liability or consequential damages
- Why: Liability should be proportional to compensation. Unlimited liability is unreasonable risk.

4. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS
- Standard: Client owns deliverables, freelancer retains portfolio rights
- Acceptable: Client owns work product, freelancer can showcase with permission
- Red Flag: All IP including pre-existing work, or perpetual non-compete
- Why: Freelancers should retain their tools, methods, and ability to show their work.

5. NON-COMPETE RESTRICTIONS
- Standard: None (Section 27 of Indian Contract Act makes broad non-competes void)
- Acceptable: Project-specific confidentiality for reasonable duration
- Red Flag: Cannot work in same industry, cannot work with competitors
- Why: Section 27 of Indian Contract Act, 1872 states that agreements in restraint of trade are void.

6. JURISDICTION
- Standard: Indian courts in freelancer's city or mutually agreed city
- Acceptable: Any major Indian city with good court infrastructure
- Red Flag: Foreign jurisdiction (USA, UK, Singapore, etc.)
- Why: Resolving disputes in foreign courts is prohibitively expensive for Indian freelancers.

7. SCOPE CLARITY
- Standard: Clearly defined deliverables, milestones, and revision limits
- Acceptable: Defined scope with reasonable change request process
- Red Flag: "As needed", "at client discretion", unlimited revisions
- Why: Vague scope leads to scope creep and unpaid work.

8. WORK HOURS AND AVAILABILITY
- Standard: Project-based or defined hours per week
- Acceptable: Flexible schedule respecting freelancer's independence
- Red Flag: Must be available 24/7, cannot take other clients
- Why: Freelancers are independent contractors, not employees.

9. INDEMNIFICATION
- Standard: Mutual indemnification for respective breaches
- Acceptable: Contractor indemnifies for IP infringement of their work
- Red Flag: One-sided indemnification for all possible claims
- Why: Risk should be shared fairly based on who is responsible.

10. WARRANTIES
- Standard: Work will be completed professionally and free of major defects
- Acceptable: 30-90 day warranty period for bug fixes
- Red Flag: Perpetual warranty or warranty for third-party components
- Why: Reasonable warranty protects both parties without undue burden.
